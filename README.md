Malaria Detection CNN Model

This project hosts a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images of blood cells, 
determining whether they are infected with malaria. Built with a focus on accuracy and efficiency, 
this model serves as a step forward in automating the diagnosis process, potentially speeding up the detection 
and treatment planning for affected individuals.
