#Malaria Detection CNN Model

This project hosts a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to classify images of blood cells, 
determining whether they are infected with malaria. Built with a focus on accuracy and efficiency, 
this model serves as a step forward in automating the diagnosis process, potentially speeding up the detection 
and treatment planning for affected individuals.

Prerequisites
Before running the model, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or newer
pip (Python package installer)
Virtualenv (optional, for creating a virtual environment)
